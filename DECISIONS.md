# DECISIONS — task 1.1 (snapshot layer)

Ambiguities encountered while implementing `spec/snapshot-schema-spec.md`,
with the chosen reading for each. Per the standing change process, entries
marked **[amendment proposed]** should go to the spec's open-decisions
register / an upstream amendment; the code implements the stated reading
until the register rules otherwise.

---

## D-0 — Spec reading implemented (identity, hashing, diff)

Recorded so review can check the implementation against one statement of
intent rather than reverse-engineering it from code.

**Object identity (S-1).** The tuple `(system, kind, schema, name)`. One
snapshot describes one system, so the within-diff key is
`(kind, schema, name)`; the diff engine errors if the two snapshots'
`system` fields differ, and errors on duplicate identities inside one
snapshot (a diff keyed on a non-unique key is ill-defined; see D-6).

**Hash inclusion (S-2, §5).**
`schema_hash = "sha256:" + hex(sha256(utf8(canonical_json(projection))))`
where projection =

- `kind`, `schema`, `name`
- `columns`: each reduced to `{name, type, nullable, default, ordinal}`
  (column `description` excluded), sorted by `ordinal`
- `keys`: complete, ordered per §6 rule 5
- `stats`: only the hash-included §4.5 fields for the object's kind
  (`definition`, `data_type`, `scope`, `formula`, `is_key_event`)

Excluded: object `description`, column `description`s, hash-excluded stats
(`row_estimate`), and every envelope field. Canonical JSON per §6: compact,
UTF-8, keys sorted lexicographically at every nesting level.

**Diff classification (§7).** Keyed on identity: only-in-new → `added`
(additive); only-in-old → `removed` (breaking); both present with different
`schema_hash` → `changed_structural` with field-level sub-diffs; hash equal
but canonical object bodies differ → `changed_metadata_only`; byte-equal →
`unchanged`. Sub-diff severities exactly per the §7 table; rename candidate
flagged when a removed and an added column in the same object share
`type` + `ordinal` (both interpretations surfaced; the removal stays
breaking).

## D-1 — `source_mode` must be excluded from the canonical body **[amendment proposed]**

§3 defines *canonical body* as "the envelope minus `captured_at` and
`connector`", which would leave `source_mode` inside it. But:

- S-4 / envelope table: `source_mode` "MUST NOT affect the canonical body";
- §8.2 fixture 2: `supabase-live.json` "must be canonical-body-identical"
  to `supabase-ddl.json` — impossible if the differing `source_mode` field
  is part of the body;
- C-3 requires byte-identical canonical bodies across modes.

These are satisfiable only if the canonical body excludes `source_mode` as
well. **Chosen reading:** canonical body := envelope minus `captured_at`,
`connector`, **and `source_mode`** (all three are per-run provenance).
Proposed amendment: §3's definition line should name all three exclusions.

## D-2 — Severity of structural changes not listed in the §7 sub-diff table

The §7 severity table does not classify: (a) a column `ordinal` change
(hash-included, so it *is* structural), (b) an `is_key_event` toggle
(hash-included per §4.5, but the API row in §7 names only
`data_type`/`scope`/`formula`), (c) appearance/disappearance of a
hash-included stats field (e.g. a `formula` added to a metric).

**Chosen reading:** any hash-affecting change the table does not name is
classified **breaking**. Rationale: the hash exists precisely to trigger
severity classification + contamination scan (S-2); the safe failure mode
for an unclassified structural change is to scan unnecessarily, never to
skip a scan. Applies to (a), (b), (c). Field appearance/disappearance is
reported as that field "changed" (absent → value / value → absent).

## D-3 — §7 footnote 3 (definition-change downgrade) not implementable in 1.1

A view/matview `definition` change is "downgraded to additive-with-note
when re-derived lineage shows the output column set and mappings are
unchanged." Lineage re-derivation is task 1.9 and a separate artifact
(out of scope per the snapshot spec §1). **Chosen reading:** in task 1.1
the diff engine always reports `definition` changes as **breaking**; the
sync engine (CP-3) applies the downgrade once lineage exists. The sub-diff
carries `downgradable: true` so the sync engine can find the candidates.

## D-4 — Exact shape of the hash projection

§5 lists *what* is included but not the projected document's shape.
**Chosen reading:** the projection is a reduced object document —
hash-included stats stay nested under a `stats` key (empty `{}` when the
kind has none), and `keys` is carried **verbatim-complete** (after §6
ordering), including empty arrays if the producer emitted them.
Consequence worth a connector-contract note: `"keys": {}` and
`"keys": {"primary": []}` hash differently, so a connector must emit key
arrays consistently across runs and modes (C-2/C-3 will catch drift here).
The fixtures in this repo omit empty key arrays (`"keys": {}`).

## D-5 — GA4 key events: `is_key_event` flag, not the `key` schema namespace

§4.2 allows `api_event` `schema` ∈ `standard | custom | key`, *and* §4.5
registers `stats.is_key_event` (hash-included). Both mechanisms at once
would be redundant, and moving an event to `schema: "key"` when it is
promoted would change its identity (S-1) — a key-event toggle would then
diff as a breaking removed+added pair instead of a structural change on one
object. **Chosen reading:** `schema` records the event's origin namespace
(`standard` | `custom`); promotion to key event is the hash-included
`stats.is_key_event` flag (surfaces as `changed_structural`, identity
stable). The `key` namespace is reserved for key events the connector can
enumerate only from the key-events list without a corresponding event
entry. Fixtures use the flag reading.

## D-6 — Diff-engine input contract

(a) The diff engine trusts each object's *stored* `schema_hash` (C-4 makes
producers accountable for it); an optional `verify_hashes` mode recomputes
and raises on mismatch, used in the conformance suite. (b) Snapshots of
different `system`s → error (§7: "two snapshots of the same `system`").
(c) Duplicate identity within one snapshot → error; the validator CLI also
reports this beyond plain JSON-Schema validation. (d) Unknown `kind`s are
skipped with a logged warning per S-5 — in the diff they are invisible,
which is the ruling's stated cost. (e) `source_properties` changes are not
a §7 classification (they are envelope facts, SS-3); the diff reports a
boolean `source_properties_changed` informationally, with no severity.

## D-7 — Fixture set vs spec §8.2

Task instructions require one fixture per system; spec §8.2 lists five for
the 1.1 exit. Shipped: `supabase-ddl.json`, `ga4.json`, `gsc.json`, and
`drift-pair/` (before/after staging every §7 classification incl. a rename
candidate). `supabase-live.json` is included but **hand-derived** from
`supabase-ddl.json` (same body, `source_mode: "live"`, later
`captured_at`): it exercises the canonical-body-identity *machinery*, but
is not evidence of connector mode-invariance — the real C-3 stays skipped
until task 1.2 produces it by live introspection. The suite names these
apart (`test_fixture_pair_canonical_body_identity` vs the skipped C-3).

## D-8 — Stack choice

CLAUDE.md's stack line was an unset placeholder. Chosen: **Python 3.12 +
jsonschema (Draft 2020-12) + pytest + hypothesis** (first suggested option;
jsonschema is needed for §8.1 verbatim, hypothesis for the required
property tests). CLAUDE.md placeholder filled accordingly.

## D-9 — Repo-path discrepancies **[resolved 2026-07-12]**

Originally: specs lived at `spec/` while every document said `specs/`, and
`phase1-supabase-ga4-gsc-plan.md` was absent, so the snapshot spec (which
states it formalizes that plan's §4) was treated as the authority. Both
resolved after task 1.1 landed: the directory was renamed to `specs/` and
the phase-1 plan added. Post-hoc reconciliation confirmed the reading —
see D-10.

## D-10 — Phase-1 plan §4 is the superseded draft of the snapshot schema

`specs/phase1-supabase-ga4-gsc-plan.md` §4 labels itself "draft schema",
and the snapshot spec's header says it *formalizes* that section, so where
they differ the snapshot spec governs. The differences, for the record —
draft-form snapshots are **intentionally rejected** by the §8.1 schema:

- draft columns lack `ordinal`; formal spec requires it (drives §6 order)
- draft FK is three-part `"ref": "public.users.id"` with no `ref_columns`;
  formal spec splits into two-part `ref` + `ref_columns` (the fk `ref`
  pattern `^[^.]+\.[^.]+$` rejects the draft form)
- draft kind list omits `materialized_view`; formal §4.2 registers it
- draft envelope lacks `connector` and `source_properties`; formal spec
  requires `connector`

Everything the plan pins concretely matches the implementation: GSC's
fixed dimension/metric set (§3.3) is byte-for-byte the `gsc.json` fixture;
GA4 custom definitions carry `data_type`/`scope`/`formula` in `stats`
(§3.2/§4); mode-identical snapshots (§1) is S-4/C-3.

One new observation, register-item candidate for task 1.2: plan §3.1 says
live introspection covers **indexes**, but snapshot v1 has no slot for
non-constraint indexes (`keys` holds primary/foreign/unique only; no §4.5
stats registration). Either they are deliberately dropped at the boundary
or a `stats` registration is needed when 1.2 is built — not a 1.1 concern,
recorded so 1.2 doesn't guess silently.

# DECISIONS — connector SDK harness (`connectors/sdk/`, shared by 1.2–1.4)

Ambiguities encountered implementing the connector-side halves of
`specs/job-protocol-spec.md`, `specs/capability-interfaces-spec.md`
(manifest + MetadataProvider), and snapshot delivery validation (J-6).

## D-11 — Harness owns the envelope; `introspect` returns facts only

Neither spec states who assembles the snapshot envelope. **Chosen
reading:** the connector's `introspect(config)` returns an
`IntrospectionResult` (`system_class`, `objects` without `schema_hash`,
optional `source_properties`); the harness stamps `snapshot_version`,
`system` (from config), `source_mode` (from `config.mode`),
`captured_at`, and `connector` (from the manifest), and computes every
`schema_hash` via the 1.1 library. Consequences: MP-1
(`source_mode == config.mode`) and C-4 (hashes recompute) hold by
construction for every connector on the harness; a connector-supplied
`schema_hash` is verified against the recomputation and a mismatch
fails emission — supplied hashes are never trusted.

## D-12 — Manifest stays spec-pure; code binding is SDK-local

`connector.yaml` carries exactly the §3 contract shape — no Python
entry-point field was added. Binding a manifest to code is the
SDK-local `Connector` object (manifest + handlers keyed by capability
name), addressed on the CLI as `MODULE:ATTR`. CC-1 splits accordingly:
`load_manifest` proves the file (structure, §4.2 capability→job-type
registry membership, protocol/snapshot version pins per CI-E, valid
Draft 2020-12 `config_schema`); `Connector` assembly proves the code
(declared capabilities ↔ registered handlers, both directions — an
undeclared handler is a release mistake since claim matching reads
only the manifest). `rate_limit.strategy` is an enum of what the SDK
ships (`none`, `token-bucket`); backoff/quota *primitives* land with
the GA4 task.

## D-13 — Emission gate: consumer leniencies are producer errors

J-6 dead-letters invalid deliveries server-side; the harness mirrors
the whole gate connector-side as `EmissionError` (code
`validation_error`, non-retryable) so a bad snapshot fails loudly at
the producer. Producer-side strictness deliberately exceeds the
consumer-side validator: unknown `kind` is an error (S-7 producers may
emit only registered kinds; S-5 skip-with-warning is for consumers),
unregistered `stats` fields are an error (C-8 at emission time, for
every connector), and any validator *warning* is treated as an error.
All-or-nothing (S-6) sits in the runner: introspection is one call,
any exception fails the whole job, and nothing is written on failure
(the CLI write is atomic temp+rename, so no partial file can exist).

## D-14 — Transport seam = `run_job → JobOutcome`; local CLI first

The pluggable-transport requirement is met by keeping the engine pure:
`run_job(connector, job) -> JobOutcome`, where the outcome's three
states mirror the three terminal wire calls (`succeeded`→`complete`,
`failed`→`fail`, `deferred`→`defer` with `retry_after_s`, J-5). A
transport is whatever builds a `Job` and disposes of the outcome; the
local CLI (`python -m connectors.sdk.local`, exit codes 0/1/2/3 =
ok/failed/usage/deferred) is the first, and the job-protocol runner
later maps the same outcome onto HTTP without touching connector code.
Claims, leases, and heartbeats are deliberately absent (task scope
fence); `Job.credentials` carries vault references but resolution is
unimplemented until 1.2 live mode needs it — `introspect(config)`
keeps the task-stated signature, and credential threading is a 1.2
decision, not silently pre-empted here.

## D-15 — Stack and demo-mode notes

PyYAML added as a dependency (manifests are `connector.yaml` per §3;
amends D-8's stack list). The static demo declares metadata mode
`ddl-file` rather than inventing a `static` mode: `source_mode` is a
closed §3 enum and the manifest schema enforces it — a new mode would
be a snapshot-spec amendment, not a connector choice.
